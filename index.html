  <p style="font family: times"> 
    I am an action-focused individual with an exceptional background. I attended a summer camp hold by the Citi Bank in 2016 and worked as a part-time job with UGA Dining Service as a cashier in Tate Student Center. These two working experiences gave me an engaging demeanor experienced in working with various age group. I understand the importance of working as a group and how to make contribution to the group and make everyone in this group benefit.
